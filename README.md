# Virtual Workspace

## Project Overview
This project is a **Virtual WorkspaceApplication** that allows users to:
- Create and join chat rooms.
- Exchange real-time messages using WebSocket technology.
- Seamlessly interact through a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features Implemented
### Backend
- **Express.js Server**:
  - Built with `Express.js` for managing RESTful API endpoints.
  - API Routes for user authentication, room management, and chat.
- **Socket.IO Integration**:
  - Real-time communication using WebSocket protocol.
  - Users can join specific chat rooms and broadcast messages to the entire room.
- **Room Management**:
  - Users can create rooms and join existing rooms via unique codes.
  - Notifications are sent to all users in a room when a new user joins or leaves.

### Frontend
- **Flutter Application**:
  - A modern UI built using Flutter for mobile users.
  - Includes features for room creation, joining rooms, and sending messages.
  - Integrates seamlessly with WebSocket to provide real-time updates.
- **Provider Pattern**:
  - State management is handled using the `Provider` package.
  - Ensures efficient management of WebSocket connections and message streams.

## Current Functionality
1. **Room Creation**:
   - Rooms are created with a unique code generated by the backend.
   - The code is displayed to the user upon successful creation.

2. **Joining Rooms**:
   - Users can enter the room code to join an existing room.
   - Backend manages room memberships and emits notifications to all users in the room.

3. **Real-Time Messaging**:
   - Messages are sent and received instantly via WebSocket.
   - Users in the same room can see all messages broadcasted to the room.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Frontend**: Flutter, Provider
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user authentication and room storage)
